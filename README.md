try-cb-nodejs
===============

A sample application and dataset for getting started with Couchbase 4.0 or later.  The application runs a single page UI for demonstrating query capabilities.   The application uses Couchbase Server +  Node.js + Express + Angular and boostrap.   The application is a flight planner that allows the user to search for and select a flight route (including return flight) based on airports and dates. Airport selection is done dynamically using an angular typeahead bound to cb server query.   Date selection uses date time pickers and then searches for applicable air flight routes from a previously populated database.

## Installation and Configuration
The steps below assume you are running a standalone couchbase instance running kv, indexing, fts (in Couchbase 4.5 or later) and query services on the same server where the node application will also be running.  The config.json file in the root of this application can be edited to handle more complex topologies such as running couchbase server inside a vm, or pointing to a docker instance.

 - [1] Install a Couchbase Server, and start it.   There is no need to manually configure the server through the admin UI, step 3 (below) will **automatically** provision couchbase and the application.   If you've already configured a local instance of Couchbase Server 4.0 or newer, the application can use this instance as long as you specify the credentials to connect to Couchbase within the application configuration file.

 - [2] Install Node.js

 - [3] Make a directory, clone this repo, install dependencies, start the application.  From a terminal:

    **mkdir ~/try-cb   
    git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-nodejs.git ~/try-cb   
    cd ~/try-cb**   

    **NOTE**:_The remainder of this step uses npm to "build" a cluster.  If you already have a configured instance of Couchbase Server, edit the "config.json file in the root of the cloned repository and change the username and password fields to match the credentials you entered when you setup couchbase. You can also skip the remainder of this step.  You can also configure the application to use a remote instance of couchbase or MDS by editing the endPoint, n1qlService and hostname fields.  For further information on MDS, refer to the Couchbase Documentation_

    **npm run build**  _This step may be omitted if you already have a configured instance of couchbase_

 - [4] After the cluster has been built, to start the application run from a terminal:

    **npm run start**

 - [5] Open a browser and load the url http://localhost:3000

**NOTE**: Once the application has provisioned the cluster, if 'npm run build' is executed again the application will first check the cluster is not already provisioned.   It will not modify an already provisioned cluster.  Use 'npm start' to start the application at any point in the future.
